The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p><br></p><p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use, which is accessible at Swan: Fasting Tracker Diet App unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p><p><br></p><p>**Information Collection and Use**</p><p><br></p><p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain Personal Information, including but not limited to Gender, Weight, Name, E-mail, Measurement System (kgs, lbs), Fasts.
